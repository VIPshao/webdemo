<h2>History</h2>
<p>
	JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich 
	of Netscape under the name Mocha, which was later 
	renamed to LiveScript, and finally to JavaScript. 
	LiveScript was the official name for the language 
	when it first shipped in beta releases of Netscape Navigator 2.0 
	in September 1995, but it was renamed JavaScript in a joint 
	announcement with Sun Microsystems on December 4, 1995, 
	when it was deployed in the Netscape browser version 2.0B3.
